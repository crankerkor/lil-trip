[HITCHIKE]

@Norway

- Vehicles with Norwegian green license plates do not have rear seats. Except some vans.

@Denmark

- The best spot to hitchhike to Sweden is probably at Kastrup Airport(Copenhagen). Take the 
metro to the station "Lufthavnen / Copenhagen Airport", leave the terminal on the other side 
of the metro exit to the large parking lot and then go to the roundabout at the end, next to 
McDonalds/Netto/Statoil.
