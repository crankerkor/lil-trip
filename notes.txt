- The Hurtigruten is a daily shipping service on Norway's coast, it stops in most towns 
along the way, starting in Bergen and going all the way up to Kirkenes on the Russian border. 
In many towns it stops for 3 or 4 hours and while it's in port, you can go onboard as a visitor 
for free. Just have your ID handy. Many ships have saunas and some have hot tubs that you can use 
for free.

[FERRIES]
@Norway
- Hitch on the side where the cars drive into the ferry because in many places it's hard to 
hitch on the other side. 
- You can maybe knock on people's windows when they wait for the ferry, especially if they 
come early and have to wait long, it's easy to talk to them.
- You can maybe try to hitch into cars that have already paid for the ferry but on almost all 
car ferries, and definitely all the short distance ones, you pay extra for each passenger.
- When the ferry arrives and the ticket sellers (can recognize them easily) are busy making 
tickets to cars just enter the ferry and nobody will tell you anything, the guys at the entrance 
of the boat are not supposed to check tickets just to tell cars where to go so they won't stop 
you nor anything, just think that you have already paid before.
- On hitchhiking short distance ferries that are usually paid by the amount of people in 
the car, especially around the fjords of Bergen and the Western coast of Norway: When your 
driver enters a ferry, be sure he or she is not the first or second car in line. As soon 
as the person who collects the money from the cars, is with the first or second driver, 
get out of the car, go to the sundeck - or whereever else in the ferry - and back in the 
car when the boat is on the other side. Nobody will check on you during the ride or when 
the cars leave the ferry. Thus I would highly recommend you to be in a car while boarding 
a ferry. If you are not, just ask a few drivers! If you still cannot find a car, there's 
also a few possibilities to sneak if you time it right and you are not seen by the officials.
