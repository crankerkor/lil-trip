[Norway]
- Vehicles with Norwegian green license plates do not have rear seats. Except some vans.
- On hitchhiking short distance ferries that are usually paid by the amount of people in 
the car, especially around the fjords of Bergen and the Western coast of Norway: When your 
driver enters a ferry, be sure he or she is not the first or second car in line. As soon 
as the person who collects the money from the cars, is with the first or second driver, 
get out of the car, go to the sundeck - or whereever else in the ferry - and back in the 
car when the boat is on the other side. Nobody will check on you during the ride or when 
the cars leave the ferry. Thus I would highly recommend you to be in a car while boarding 
a ferry. If you are not, just ask a few drivers! If you still cannot find a car, there's 
also a few possibilities to sneak if you time it right and you are not seen by the officials.
