[GENERAL]
@Denmark

- Dumpster diving (Copenhagen): If you get stuck in the area or just get hungry, then at this spot - E20, highway exit 59, Fredericia S (First highway exit on Jutland). You can find two supermarkets ALDI and REMA 1000, where to dumpster dive in + a Statoil, where to wash everything. And small forest/bushes, where to stay for the night.

[HITCHIKE]

@Norway

- Vehicles with Norwegian green license plates do not have rear seats. Except some vans.

- On hitchhiking short distance ferries that are usually paid by the amount of people in 
the car, especially around the fjords of Bergen and the Western coast of Norway: When your 
driver enters a ferry, be sure he or she is not the first or second car in line. As soon 
as the person who collects the money from the cars, is with the first or second driver, 
get out of the car, go to the sundeck - or whereever else in the ferry - and back in the 
car when the boat is on the other side. Nobody will check on you during the ride or when 
the cars leave the ferry. Thus I would highly recommend you to be in a car while boarding 
a ferry. If you are not, just ask a few drivers! If you still cannot find a car, there's 
also a few possibilities to sneak if you time it right and you are not seen by the officials.

@Denmark

- The best spot to hitchhike to Sweden is probably at Kastrup Airport(Copenhagen). Take the 
metro to the station "Lufthavnen / Copenhagen Airport", leave the terminal on the other side 
of the metro exit to the large parking lot and then go to the roundabout at the end, next to 
McDonalds/Netto/Statoil.


[FERRIES]
@Denmark-Sweden:
 - You can hitchhike a ride onto the ferry, often finding a direct ride to Gothenburg or Stockholm, by standing in front of the ticket booth with a sign of your destination.
